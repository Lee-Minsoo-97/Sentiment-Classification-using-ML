# üìä Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive sentiment analysis project conducted by **Minsoo Lee**. The goal of this project is to classify customer reviews into **positive**, **neutral**, and **negative** sentiments using various text processing techniques and machine learning models.

## üöÄ Project Overview

- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, POS Tagging, Lemmatization, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Parsing
- **Feature Extraction:** Bag of Words (BoW) using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Sentiment Classification Models:**
  - Lexicon-Based Approach (VADER)
  - Naive Bayes Classifier
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run This Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. **Open with Google Colab:**

   - Upload the notebook to Colab or run directly if cloned from GitHub.

3. **Install required packages:**

## üìä Results Summary

- **VADER (Lexicon-Based):** Accuracy: 86%
- **Naive Bayes:** Accuracy: 86%
- **SVM:** Accuracy: 89%
- **Logistic Regression (TF-IDF):** Accuracy: 85%

SVM performed the best with the highest accuracy, while VADER showed robust results in lexicon-based analysis.

## üìå Key Observations

- Lexicon-based approaches like VADER are fast but may lack deep contextual understanding.
- Machine learning models, especially SVM, perform better with sufficient training data.
- Logistic Regression with TF-IDF captures more nuanced sentiment features.
